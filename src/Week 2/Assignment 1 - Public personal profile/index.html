            <h2>Things about me</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Hello there my name is Jared Esquivel and here are some interesting things about myself. First of all I'm a computer science major
                <br> who is currently attending their second year at Weber State University. Another thing about me is that I have been in multiple
                <br> robotics competitions in the past which were FLL, FTC, VIQC , VRC, and last FRC on which I alway choose to be on the building group
                <br> for the robot(s) for the competition that occurred for the given year and from robotics I received an award for the 2017-2018 VIQC
                <br> robotics competition which was the outstanding student of the year. I also am not currently participating in any school-related activities as of now.</p>

            <h2>My current projects</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Video game collection: One of the longest-running projects I have is to have a shelf full of more or so common consoles from the<br>
                Atari 2600xt to the Nintendo Switch. Currently, I am redoing the wire management for the consoles as I changed the cube organizer<br> 
                that I was previously using. Another project I am working on is to have a room VR setup to have some for me and my family to have fun.<br>
                The project consisted of using a rift s headset that a friend gifted to me and to use valve index controllers instead of the Rift S<br>
                ones as I thought that the valve index controllers were unique and interesting and that I would be worth the time to set them up to <br>
                be used with the rift s headset. This is the last major project that I am working on is a home lab server with the purpose first to run<br> 
                some smalls servers for my family and cousins so that they may play, To run a plex media server of the movies that I have made a digital<br>
                copy from the discs that I have, and to work as a NAS storage with the use a Dell Powervault MD1200 JBOD disk array. I plan to run this<br>
                on a Dell Poweredge R720xd as it is more power efficient than some of the other servers that I have seen and has multiple upgrade<br> 
                options for future development.</p>

            <h2>Some of my interests</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>One interest I have is towards all kinds of electronics that are strange or unique as I get bored of seeing the same devices and machines<br>
                that look similar or have similar functions. One of the more recent electronics that I've been fascinated with is the LG V60 phone because<br>
                on the surface it is a regular phone but it had an interesting accessory called the dual screen which is as it sounds a secondary screen<br> 
                attached to a case for the phone which LG has apparently done for years with various models of phones but I focused on the V60 as it was their<br> 
                last flagship phone.</p>

            <h2>Some of my hobbies</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The biggest hobby I have is playing the YuGiOh! Trading card game as I enjoy going every once in a while to play with a local playgroup at a<br> 
                store in bountiful called Game Haven as the players there are friendly and they are competitive which forces me to think of various strategies<br> 
                to be able to defeat them. Another hobby I have had for many years is radio-controlled vehicles such as drones, helicopters, planes, and boats.<br> 
                I have enjoyed this hobby because I can mess around with making fast-moving miniature vehicles and I can learn how such small mechanical vehicles<br> 
                function. This last hobby is one that I have recently started which is sewing because </p>
